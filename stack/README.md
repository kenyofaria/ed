# The main features of classical stack implementation

1. Ordered Collection: Elements in a stack are arranged in a specific order.
<br><br>

2. LIFO Principle: The core principle of a stack is that the last element added is the first one to be removed. Imagine a stack of plates; you always take the top plate, which was the last one placed.
<br><br>
3. Restricted Access:  Access to elements within the stack is limited. You can only interact with the element at the top of the stack.
<br><br>
4. Two Primary Operations:

    1. Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.   

    2. Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
<br><br>
5. Additional Operations (Common but not always essential):

    1. Peek/Top: Allows you to view the top element without removing it.   

    2. isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.

    3. isFull: (In implementations with a fixed size) Checks if the stack is full.
